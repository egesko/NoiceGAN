# YoanoGAN
YoanoGAN (You Only Add Noise Once) is a generative adversarial network that uses a discriminator and a generator model to estimate correct distribution of noises to sample from and introduce to a medium with sole purpose of reducing the accuracy of any arbitrary classification model trained on noisy samples from the same medium.
